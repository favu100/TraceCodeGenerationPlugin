# TraceCodeGenerationPlugin

This is a plugin for [ProB2-UI](https://github.com/bendisposto/prob2-ui). 
Using the animation and model checking techniques of ProB provides the opportunity to generate a trace satisfying certain properties.
With this plugin it is possible to generate Java, C++ and B code from a trace.
[ProB2-UI](https://github.com/bendisposto/prob2-ui) and this plugin in combination are used to generate the benchmark files for the code generator [B2Program](https://github.com/favu100/b2program/tree/master/benchmarks)
E.g. the operation `simulate` in [Cruise_finite1_deterministic_exec](https://github.com/favu100/b2program/blob/master/benchmarks/ProB/Cruise_finite1_deterministic_exec.mch) consists of
a sequence of operation calls generated by a trace with a loop returning to the initial state.

## Usage
Run `./gradlew fatJar` to build the JAR file for the plugin. It can then be used with the plugin mechanism in [ProB2-UI](https://github.com/bendisposto/prob2-ui)
